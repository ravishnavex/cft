Attempt to create an architecture

Problem?

We want to automate the deployment of MediaWiki using Kubernetes/CFT/Terraform/Docker (No Docker compose)
I will be choosing CFT.

We'll start with one instance of MediaWiki running, backed by a MySQL server running on a separate VM.
To be installed using given steps

Other issues?

A plan for deploying and scaling the above application on a public cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure etc). This can include diagrams and documents and/or configuration scripts. 
Suggestions for scaling, if any.

We will choose AWS.
